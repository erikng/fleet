# Stay on course with your security compliance goals

![Security compliance goals](../website/assets/images/articles/security-compliance-goals-cover-800x450@2x.jpg)

Pursuing security compliance is a long journey. It isn’t so much taking a road trip as it’s setting sail on the open ocean. Regulatory changes can knock you off course. Learning a new technology can take the wind out of your sails. And no matter how hard you try, you can never reach the horizon.

Are you feeling a little seasick? Don’t worry. There are ways to navigate the waters of security compliance and still enjoy smooth sailing.

We’ve explored how to [get and stay compliant](https://fleetdm.com/use-cases/get-and-stay-compliant-across-your-devices-with-fleet) before. In this article, we’ll walk through the steps you can take to measure progress toward compliance — and how Fleet can make this task more manageable.

## Set your goals

One of the reasons compliance is so complicated is that there isn’t a single set of rules. You have to determine what compliance means for your organization.

Are you creating internal processes and controls to stay secure? Is there a law or regulation required to do business? Which industry standards should you meet if you truly want to compete?

Answering questions like these is the first step to becoming compliant. After all, you can’t measure progress until you know where you’re going.

## Be realistic

Achieving the highest level of compliance for your industry is an admirable goal. But pursuing compliance perfection could tie up daily business operations.

For instance, if your organization has 30 employees who use MacBooks, it might be possible to make sure they all have the latest version of macOS installed. That goal gets more challenging to achieve as those MacBooks multiply and employees elect to use other operating systems, devices, or even servers. Maybe then you just want to make sure they have auto updates enabled.

Be sure to set goals based on the resources you have available, and try not to let perfection stand in the way of progress.

## Limit the scope

While your industry may have compliance standards, these recommendations may not apply to your entire organization.

Let’s look at the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/) or PCI DSS. This is a set of standards that aims to protect debit and credit card transactions against data theft and fraud. This is pretty important if your organization plans to accept card payments. But how many of your teams are in the position to collect payments — or even interact with customers?

There may be processes that apply to your entire company, like using multi-factor authentication. These types of requirements have a great impact on improving security. But this isn’t always the case. Some of the requirements either don't make sense, or have very limited impact on actual security. Knowing which compliance standards apply to which teams will help lighten the load across your organization.

## Delegate to team leads

Ultimately, your CISO, Head of Security or Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring compliance, depending on the structure of your organization. Asking them to check the progress of each team and individual, in addition to their other responsibilities, isn’t exactly efficient (or fair).

Your company could hire more security specialists, like devops engineers. Some organizations have thousands on staff, but we know this isn’t always a realistic option. The good news is that you don’t necessarily need more security and compliance people — just more people with security skills.

The lead devops engineers know exactly how your cloud environments are configured at scale, and when given visibility into what needs to be done, are the people with the best skills to get it done properly. Provide your technical experts with the reasoning behind the compliance requirements as well as with the visibility they need to know which systems are or aren't compliant.

## Fleet makes tracking compliance easy

Your team leads don’t need a crash course in security and compliance to measure compliance progress. With Fleet, you can create [policies](https://fleetdm.com/securing/what-are-fleet-policies) that ask questions about your devices — questions you can customize to meet your compliance goals. You can then group these custom queries with [teams](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/teams), eliminating unnecessary processes and lowering the level of effort for your organization.

Fleet also lets you [assign users different levels of access](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/permissions): Observer, Maintainer, and Admin. So, your Head of Security can create policies and assign them to different teams — preparing team leads to run queries for up-to-the-minute data on devices. Though that might not be necessary. Fleet policies automatically refresh every hour.

Fleet policies, teams, and permissions empower employees at every level of your organization to share the responsibility of measuring compliance. With more hands on deck, reaching your goals will be a breeze. You can even enable [policy automations](https://fleetdm.com/docs/using-fleet/automations#policy-automations) that let you create tickets in external systems when a policy fails.
